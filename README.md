1/1 [==============================] - 2s 2s/step

(512, 1)

2.0881891 # this is how better NN performs than row/col-wise point connection. 16.02.2024 - previous, worse architecture. loss now updated, we will see what happen. bills are growing so.


my tf crashed after nvidia driver update (this one from january 2024). so, i have to use cpu so far.
